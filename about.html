							<p><strong>Hi, I'm Christoforos.</strong></p>

							<p>
								I'm a <strong>game developer</strong>, but you'll figure that out as you browse this
								site.
								What matters more to me is the <em>mindset</em> &nbsp;behind it: I enjoy building things
								with
								<strong>meaning, originality, and purpose</strong>. Things that feel good to use and
								show
								care, heart, and thought. I'm not in this for fame or quick wins. I'm here because I
								<strong>love the process</strong>.
							</p>

							<p>
								I’m also a <strong>dad of twin girls</strong>, which means life is full, loud, and
								beautiful.
								I find peace in the forest, joy in music, and a kind of calm focus in <em>anime</em>,
								<em>video games</em>, and <em>animation</em>. I love a good idea, a better conversation,
								and people who genuinely try to make things better.
							</p>

							<p>
								I'm not money-driven, but I believe in <strong>fair pay for good work</strong>.
								I see <strong>AI</strong> as a tool, helpful and powerful, but never a replacement for
								<strong>originality</strong> or <strong>respect</strong> for other people's effort.
								I'm not into shortcuts. I like figuring things out.
							</p>

							<p>
								I care about <strong>ethics</strong>. I care about <strong>people</strong>.
								And I care about doing things the <em>right way</em>, even when it takes more time,
								energy, or effort.
							</p>

					<div class="whoami-layout">
						<div class="whoami-text">
							<p><strong>Before I stepped into tech</strong>, I had a few jobs that shaped my work ethic
								and taught me the value of showing up and doing your best. Things really took off in
								<strong>2014</strong> when I earned my <strong>Cisco certification</strong> and joined
								<strong>Printec</strong> as an intern, working at the <strong>Athens International
									Airport IT helpdesk</strong>. Not long after, I became part of a dedicated team
								working exclusively with the <strong>Common Use Terminal Equipment (CUTE)</strong>
								systems inside the airport. It was a serious operation, and I learned fast. I stayed in
								that role until I left for my mandatory <strong>military service</strong> in
								<strong>November 2016</strong>.
							</p>

							<p>In <strong>2017</strong>, I returned to the airport with <strong>Netsquare</strong>,
								taking on the role of <strong>Site Administrator</strong> for <strong>SITA</strong>, a
								company delivering essential communication and system infrastructure to airports and
								airlines across the globe. I was later promoted to <strong>Team Leader</strong> and
								<strong>Trainer</strong>.
							</p>

							<p>That was also when I first started exploring <strong>game development</strong> in my own
								time. It clicked immediately, and I knew this was the direction I wanted to grow in.
								Eventually, I shifted my focus to <strong>Unity</strong>. I spent thousands of hours
								learning the engine, building things from scratch, breaking them, fixing them, and
								repeating that cycle again and again.</p>

							<p>In <strong>2021</strong>, I joined <strong>Renderapp (UK)</strong> as a <strong>Unity
									Developer</strong>. Renderapp's product was one of the most high-end, web-based
								automotive configurators out there, built for brands like <strong>Ford</strong>,
								<strong>Subaru</strong>, <strong>Hyundai</strong>, <strong>Genesis</strong>, and
								<strong>Caterham</strong>. It involved tools like <strong>Unity</strong>, <strong>3DS
									Max</strong>, and <strong>Node.js</strong>, and the standards were sky high.<br>
								Working at that level pushed me in all the right ways. I had to level up fast, both
								technically and professionally. My understanding of <strong>Unity</strong>,
								<strong>real-time 3D rendering</strong>, and <strong>C#</strong> grew a lot. I also
								played a big part in keeping the team moving, leading during heavy production phases,
								solving tough problems, and developing custom tools to streamline our workflow.
							</p>

							<p>If you're curious about the more technical side, you can check out my resume <a
									href="https://d3vcrow.github.io/resume.html"
									target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

							<p>In <strong>December 2024</strong>, just after becoming a father, Renderapp shut down. I
								used that time to slow down, take care of my twin baby daughters, and realign a few
								things in my life.</p>

							<p>But I didn’t stop. I kept building, kept learning, and went deeper into
								<strong>Python</strong>, especially in <strong>automation</strong> and <strong>AI
									tools</strong>. I also built this portfolio site from scratch, piece by piece.
							</p>

							<p>Now, I'm ready to bring everything I've learned, my <strong>skills</strong>,
								<strong>mindset</strong>, and <strong>experience</strong>, into the world of
								<strong>video games</strong> or <strong>Unity-based projects</strong>.

							<p>When I was a kid playing <strong>Warcraft 3</strong>, I discovered its editor and built a
								path through the forest for my orcs to escape an Alliance attack. That moment stuck with
								me. It was the first time I realized I could create something digital that others could
								experience. Back then in early 2000s Greece, saying you wanted to make games felt
								unrealistic. I never said it out loud, but it quietly shaped every step I took. Choosing
								<strong>computer science</strong> wasn't just because I liked tech and coding. Deep
								down, I knew I was chasing games, even if the path wasn’t clear yet.
							</p>

							<p>In <strong>2017</strong>, I saw an ad for a cheap online course on making video games. I
								didn’t hesitate. I just knew I had to go for it. The tool was <strong>Game
									Salad</strong>, a simple visual scripting engine, but I was hooked. A few months and
								2D projects later, someone with professional experience in the video game industry, told
								me, <em>"If you’re serious, switch to Unity."</em> So I did. And I’ve never looked back.
							</p>

							<p>By <strong>2018</strong>, I was watching every Unity tutorial I could find and creating
								small games using free assets and wild ideas. They weren’t always polished or finished,
								but they were mine and I was proud of them.</p>


							<p>In <strong>2019</strong>, I dedicated myself to a mobile quiz game called <strong>Greater
									Game</strong>, my first attempt at a commercial release. But the promised funding
								fell through. I was hurt and disappointed, and even though I could have published it on
								my own, I chose to leave it behind.</p>


							<p>In <strong>2020</strong>, my good friend <strong>Dimitris</strong> (now also my best man)
								saw his sculpting work disappear due to COVID. He pivoted into <strong>3D art</strong>.
								Since we both loved games, we teamed up to learn, grow, and build something from
								scratch.That’s how <strong>Pyles Studio</strong> was born. I had a small turn-based
								arena prototype, and he brought in beautiful environments and original models. Before
								long, others started joining us, some looking for experience, others for fun, all
								brought together by a shared passion for game development. A few of them now work at
								<strong>Blizzard</strong> and <strong>Creative Assembly</strong>.<br>That project became
								<strong>Thrion Tactics</strong>. It was never designed to be a success, just a
								collective effort and creative sandbox. But over <strong>3.5 years</strong> and more
								than <strong>5000 hours</strong>, it became our foundation. We learned by building,
								breaking, fixing, and most of all, having fun during the process.
							</p>

							<p>In <strong>2024</strong>, Dimitris created a gorgeous <strong>Greek island
									environment</strong> inspired by stories from our grandparents. I used it as a space
								to dive deep into <strong>HDRP</strong>, <strong>optimization</strong>, and
								<strong>third-person controller design</strong>. The result was something smooth,
								heartfelt, and full of potential. We’re still slowly shaping it, and maybe one day we’ll
								actually publish it.
							</p>

							<p>In <strong>January 2025</strong>, I challenged myself to build and release a full game in
								just <strong>17 days</strong>. Our twin daughters were only 3 months old, and life was,
								at best, chaotic. But I made it happen. The game is now live on
								<strong>itch.io</strong>. Although short, it reflects my creativity and the personal
								touch I try to bring into everything I build, regardless of its size.
							</p>


							<p>It might sound childish, but I’m still following that dream, and I’ll follow it wherever
								it leads.</p>

						<div class="whoami-text" style="flex: 1;">
							<p>When I talk about game design, I mean it in the broadest sense : concepts, mechanics,
								systems, structure. The ideas that take shape before a single line of code is written.
								For me, it usually starts with pen and paper, a whiteboard marker, or whatever’s nearby
								to help shape the experience.</p>

							<p>My first real experience with design came over 20 years ago. My friends and I had
								finished every quest in our favorite board game, <strong>Hero Quest</strong>. So I asked
								if they wanted me to make a new one. They said yes. I spent a few days drawing maps,
								writing the story, adding puzzles, traps, side quests, anything I could think of.</p>

							<p>We played it in one sitting. No one wanted to stop. They told me it was their favorite
								quest. That moment stuck with me. It was the first time something I created made others
								genuinely excited and engaged.</p>

							</div>

							<div class="whoami-text" style="flex: 1;">
								<p>Since then, design has always been the foundation of my creative process. After
									working on <strong>Greater Game</strong>, my mobile quiz project, I stopped seeing
									design as just a step. It became the core. I don't rush into engines. I sketch,
									plan, think. What is the purpose of this mechanic? Where does it lead? What else
									does it touch?</p>

								<p>I try to create systems that make sense together, not just a collection of fun ideas,
									but ones that support each other and feel intentional. I want experiences to feel
									smooth, connected, and clear. The kind of design that never draws attention to
									itself, but keeps everything running seamlessly.</p>

								<p>That’s what game design is to me. It’s where every great game begins. And it’s the
									part I always enjoy the most.</p>
