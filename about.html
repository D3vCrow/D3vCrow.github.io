								<p><strong>Hi, I'm Christoforos.</strong></p>
								
								<p>
									I'm a <strong>game developer</strong>, but you'll figure that out as you browse this site.
									What matters more to me is the <em>mindset</em> &nbsp;behind it: I enjoy building things with
									<strong>meaning, originality, and purpose</strong>. Things that feel good to use and show
									care, heart, and thought. I'm not in this for fame or quick wins. I'm here because I
									<strong>love the process</strong>.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									I’m also a <strong>dad of twin girls</strong>, which means life is full, loud, and beautiful.
									I find peace in the forest, joy in music, and a kind of calm focus in <em>anime</em>,
									<em>video games</em>, and <em>animation</em>. I love a good idea, a better conversation,
									and people who genuinely try to make things better.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									I'm not money-driven, but I believe in <strong>fair pay for good work</strong>.
									I see <strong>AI</strong> as a tool, helpful and powerful, but never a replacement for
									<strong>originality</strong> or <strong>respect</strong> for other people's effort.
									I'm not into shortcuts. I like figuring things out.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									I care about <strong>ethics</strong>. I care about <strong>people</strong>.
									And I care about doing things the <em>right way</em>, even when it takes more time,
									energy, or effort.
								</p>

								<p><strong>Before I stepped into tech</strong>, I had a few jobs that shaped my work ethic and taught me the value of showing up and doing your best. Things really took off in <strong>2014</strong> when I earned my <strong>Cisco certification</strong> and joined <strong>Printec</strong> as an intern, working at the <strong>Athens International Airport IT helpdesk</strong>. Not long after, I became part of a dedicated team working exclusively with the <strong>Common Use Terminal Equipment (CUTE)</strong> systems inside the airport. It was a serious operation, and I learned fast. I stayed in that role until I left for my mandatory <strong>military service</strong> in <strong>November 2016</strong>.</p>
								
								<p>In <strong>2017</strong>, I returned to the airport with <strong>Netsquare</strong>, taking on the role of <strong>Site Administrator</strong> for <strong>SITA</strong>, a company delivering essential communication and system infrastructure to airports and airlines across the globe. I was later promoted to <strong>Team Leader</strong> and <strong>Trainer</strong>.</p>
								
								<p>That was also when I first started exploring <strong>game development</strong> in my own time. It clicked immediately, and I knew this was the direction I wanted to grow in. Eventually, I shifted my focus to <strong>Unity</strong>. I spent thousands of hours learning the engine, building things from scratch, breaking them, fixing them, and repeating that cycle again and again.</p>
								
								<p>In <strong>2021</strong>, I joined <strong>Renderapp (UK)</strong> as a <strong>Unity Developer</strong>. Renderapp's product was one of the most high-end, web-based automotive configurators out there, built for brands like <strong>Ford</strong>, <strong>Subaru</strong>, <strong>Hyundai</strong>, <strong>Genesis</strong>, and <strong>Caterham</strong>. It involved tools like <strong>Unity</strong>, <strong>3DS Max</strong>, and <strong>Node.js</strong>, and the standards were sky high.<br> Working at that level pushed me in all the right ways. I had to level up fast, both technically and professionally. My understanding of <strong>Unity</strong>, <strong>real-time 3D rendering</strong>, and <strong>C#</strong> grew a lot. I also played a big part in keeping the team moving, leading during heavy production phases, solving tough problems, and developing custom tools to streamline our workflow.</p>
								
								<p>If you're curious about the more technical side, you can check out my resume <a href="https://d3vcrow.github.io/resume.html" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
								
								<p>In <strong>December 2024</strong>, just after becoming a father, Renderapp shut down. I used that time to slow down, take care of my twin baby daughters, and realign a few things in my life.</p>
								
								<p>But I didn’t stop. I kept building, kept learning, and went deeper into <strong>Python</strong>, especially in <strong>automation</strong> and <strong>AI tools</strong>. I also built this portfolio site from scratch, piece by piece.</p>
								
								<p>Now, I'm ready to bring everything I've learned, my <strong>skills</strong>, <strong>mindset</strong>, and <strong>experience</strong>, into the world of <strong>video games</strong> or <strong>Unity-based projects</strong>.</p>

								<p>When I was a kid playing <strong>Warcraft 3</strong>, I discovered its editor and built a path through the forest for my orcs to escape an Alliance attack. That moment stuck with me. It was the first time I realized I could create something digital that others could experience. Back then in early 2000s Greece, saying you wanted to make games felt unrealistic. I never said it out loud, but it quietly shaped every step I took. Choosing <strong>computer science</strong> wasn't just because I liked tech and coding. Deep down, I knew I was chasing games, even if the path wasn’t clear yet.</p>
								
								<p>In <strong>2017</strong>, I saw an ad for a cheap online course on making video games. I didn’t hesitate. I just knew I had to go for it. The tool was <strong>Game Salad</strong>, a simple visual scripting engine, but I was hooked. A few months and 2D projects later, someone with professional experience in the video game industry, told me, <em>"If you’re serious, switch to Unity."</em> So I did. And I’ve never looked back.</p>
								
								<p>By <strong>2018</strong>, I was watching every Unity tutorial I could find and creating small games using free assets and wild ideas. They weren’t always polished or finished, but they were mine and I was proud of them.</p>
								
								
								<p>In <strong>2019</strong>, I dedicated myself to a mobile quiz game called <strong>Greater Game</strong>, my first attempt at a commercial release. But the promised funding fell through. I was hurt and disappointed, and even though I could have published it on my own, I chose to leave it behind.</p>
								
								
								<p>In <strong>2020</strong>, my good friend <strong>Dimitris</strong> (now also my best man) saw his sculpting work disappear due to COVID. He pivoted into <strong>3D art</strong>. Since we both loved games, we teamed up to learn, grow, and build something from scratch.That’s how <strong>Pyles Studio</strong> was born. I had a small turn-based arena prototype, and he brought in beautiful environments and original models. Before long, others started joining us, some looking for experience, others for fun, all brought together by a shared passion for game development. A few of them now work at <strong>Blizzard</strong> and <strong>Creative Assembly</strong>.<br>That project became <strong>Thrion Tactics</strong>. It was never designed to be a success, just a collective effort and creative sandbox. But over <strong>3.5 years</strong> and more than <strong>5000 hours</strong>, it became our foundation. We learned by building, breaking, fixing, and most of all, having fun during the process.</p>
								
								<p>In <strong>2024</strong>, Dimitris created a gorgeous <strong>Greek island environment</strong> inspired by stories from our grandparents. I used it as a space to dive deep into <strong>HDRP</strong>, <strong>optimization</strong>, and <strong>third-person controller design</strong>. The result was something smooth, heartfelt, and full of potential. We’re still slowly shaping it, and maybe one day we’ll actually publish it.</p>
								
								<p>In <strong>January 2025</strong>, I challenged myself to build and release a full game in just <strong>17 days</strong>. Our twin daughters were only 3 months old, and life was, at best, chaotic. But I made it happen. The game is now live on <strong>itch.io</strong>. Although short, it reflects my creativity and the personal touch I try to bring into everything I build, regardless of its size.</p>
								
								
								<p>It might sound childish, but I’m still following that dream, and I’ll follow it wherever it leads.</p>

								<p>When I talk about game design, I mean it in the broadest sense : concepts, mechanics, systems, structure. The ideas that take shape before a single line of code is written. For me, it usually starts with pen and paper, a whiteboard marker, or whatever’s nearby to help shape the experience.</p>
								
								<p>My first real experience with design came over 20 years ago. My friends and I had finished every quest in our favorite board game, <strong>Hero Quest</strong>. So I asked if they wanted me to make a new one. They said yes. I spent a few days drawing maps, writing the story, adding puzzles, traps, side quests, anything I could think of.</p>
								
								<p>We played it in one sitting. No one wanted to stop. They told me it was their favorite quest. That moment stuck with me. It was the first time something I created made others genuinely excited and engaged.</p>

								</div>
								
								<div class="whoami-text" style="flex: 1;">
									<p>Since then, design has always been the foundation of my creative process. After working on <strong>Greater Game</strong>, my mobile quiz project, I stopped seeing design as just a step. It became the core. I don't rush into engines. I sketch, plan, think. What is the purpose of this mechanic? Where does it lead? What else does it touch?</p>
									
									<p>I try to create systems that make sense together, not just a collection of fun ideas, but ones that support each other and feel intentional. I want experiences to feel smooth, connected, and clear. The kind of design that never draws attention to itself, but keeps everything running seamlessly.</p>
									
									<p>That’s what game design is to me. It’s where every great game begins. And it’s the part I always enjoy the most.</p>
